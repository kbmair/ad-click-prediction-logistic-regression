# ðŸ“ˆ Advertisement Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression
In this project, I explore realistic advertisement data to predict whether a website user will click on an ad. Using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), I build a Logistic Regression model to drive insights that can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, reduce wasted ad spend, and increase revenue.
