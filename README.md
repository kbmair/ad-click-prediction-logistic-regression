# ðŸ“ˆ Advertisement Click Prediction Using Logistic Regression
In this project, I explored 1,000 website user records to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement. Using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), I built a Logistic Regression model that achieved 92%â€“94% precision for predicting user clicks, providing insights that can help businesses maximize advertising ROI.
